**Habit Tracker** is a versatile application designed to help users track and visualize their daily habits. 
Although initially set up for jogging, this tracker can be easily adapted to monitor any habit or activity, 
such as reading, exercising, studying, or any other personal goals.

The application uses the Pixela API to create, update, and delete data points (referred to as "pixels") 
on a graph that visually represents the user's progress over time. This provides an intuitive and graphical way 
to track progress and maintain motivation.

**Key Features:**

**1. Graphical Visualization:**
- View your habit tracking graph online via a clickable link in the application.

**2. Flexible Habit Tracking:**
- While the default setup is for tracking jogging distances, the tracker can be customized during setup to monitor any habit by modifying the labels and data inputs accordingly.

**3. User-Friendly Interface:**
- The application features a modern, themed graphical user interface (GUI) using tkinter and ttkthemes, making it aesthetically pleasing and easy to use.

**4. Date Validation:**
-   Ensures that the date entered by the user is in the correct format (YYYYMMDD), preventing invalid entries and maintaining data integrity.

**5. Add, Update, and Delete Entries:**
-  Easily add new data points, update existing ones, or delete entries with a few clicks.

**How It Works:**
- **Setup:** The user must provide their Pixela username and token, which are used to authenticate requests to the Pixela API.

- **Main Window:**
  - Title Header: Displays the habit being tracked.
  - Graph Link: Provides a direct link to the Pixela graph for visualizing the habit tracking data.
  - Add Section: Allows users to add new data points by entering the date and quantity (e.g., distance jogged).
  - Update Section: Users can update existing data points by entering the date and new quantity.
  - Delete Section: Allows users to delete data points by entering the date.

**Usage:**

**1. Adding a Pixel:**
-  Enter the date in YYYYMMDD format and the quantity (e.g., distance jogged).
-  Click "Add" to submit the data.
  
**2. Updating a Pixel:**
- Enter the date of the entry to be updated and the new quantity.
- Click "Update" to modify the data.
  
**3. Deleting a Pixel:**
- Enter the date of the entry to be deleted.
- Click "Delete" to remove the data.
